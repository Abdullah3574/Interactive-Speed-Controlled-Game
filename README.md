# Interactive-Speed-Controlled-Game
An interactive, speed-controlled game developed in Assembly Language specifically for the Intel 8086 architecture.

Functionalities include:

**Character Movement:** Display a character that continuously moves in a designated direction, starting from left to right.

**User Control:** Allow the user to change the character's direction using the arrow keys.

**Timer Interaction:** Implement a timer that updates the character's position every second. If no keys are pressed within a 5-second span, the character's speed increases by 3 tick counts.

**Game Over Condition:** Trigger a game over when the tick count reaches 3 or 0, displaying an appropriate message and ending the program.

**Termination:** Allow the user to end the program by pressing the ESC key.
